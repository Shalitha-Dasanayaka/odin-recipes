        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cupcakes, brownies, and cookies are always winners, but any small, portable baked items are good bake sale ideas. Note that bake sale cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and muffins are easier to package and sell by the piece than are cakes and pies</p>
          
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>

         <ul>
            <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅔ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>⅓ cup confectioners' sugar for decoration</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>

            <li>Return to the preheated oven for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, or until light golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Dust the top with confectioners' sugar. Cut into squares.</li>
