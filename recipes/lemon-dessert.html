        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cupcakes, brownies, and cookies are always winners, but any small, portable baked items are good bake sale ideas.</p> <p>Note that bake sale cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and muffins are easier to package and sell by the piece than are cakes and pies</p>
